Core Purpose

This mobile app is designed to help couples spice up their private time and maintain a sense of closeness. It offers a simple and fun experience that begins with one partner “ringing” the other. Once the other partner accepts, a playful coin toss decides who gets to start. The winner is then given a set of instructions or suggestions to guide the session—ranging from small foreplay tips to more detailed ideas. The app aims to make these moments a bit more exciting and varied, while still staying easy to use.

Primary Flow
Ring or Request
One partner taps a button to send a prompt to the other partner’s device. This lets them know it’s time for a private session.

Acceptance or Decline
The partner on the receiving end can accept if they’re ready or decline if it’s not a good moment. This keeps things respectful and allows both partners to decide.

Coin Toss
When the receiver accepts, the app performs a simple coin toss to pick who starts. This lighthearted step takes away any guesswork or possible awkwardness about who should begin.

Instruction and Guides
The partner chosen by the coin toss is then shown a set of ideas. These can be anything from mild suggestions to more detailed tasks, depending on user preferences. For an initial version, these suggestions might come from a stored list. Later on, there could be an option to generate content using a larger system.

Completion and Sharing
Once the session wraps up, the user has the option to share a quick note or “I just completed a challenge!” type of message on social media (without revealing any private details). The app may also show a referral link or code to invite friends, helping it reach a wider audience.

Key Features
Push Notifications: The “ring” arrives as a notification on the partner’s device, making it quick and easy to see when a session is requested.

Coin Toss Mini-Game: A short, fun animation that decides who begins. It gives the app a game-like feel.

Idea Library: Suggestions for foreplay, positions, or small tasks. In the free version, the library might be limited, while paying users can unlock more variety.

Referral System: Users get rewards or credits when they successfully invite friends to use the app.

Social Sharing: One-tap share to various platforms with a discreet message.

Badges and Challenges: Small achievements to motivate couples to try new things and keep the experience fresh.

You could include a basic analytics section in the app that keeps track of session counts and favorite categories. For example:

Session Tracking

Number of times couples use the app

Coin toss outcomes (for fun stats like total heads vs. tails)
Which user clicks on the ring the most
Which user wins the coin toss the most

Which suggestions are chosen most often

Kink or Preference Match

Have users tag or “like” certain categories (e.g., role-play, massage, playful dares)

Store these preferences in their profile

Show them more suggestions that match their interests

Simple Reporting

Give each user a quick summary of their most-used categories

Show a session count, popular times of day (optional), or overall usage trends

Let them see how their preferences compare to a broader set of users, if you choose to collect that info

Feedback Loop

Allow users to mark an idea as “great” or “not for me”

Use that data to improve future suggestions

Consider adding a small notes field where a couple can write what worked or didn’t work
